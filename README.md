# ViewHive V0.9.5.0

ViewHive is a Raspberry Pi system to periodically record videos at scheduled times and save them to external USB storage. Each video is saved as an H.264 video playable with VLC.

Scheduled recording times are set with a rotary encoder while an OLED display shows the menus and inputs.

After a period of inactivity, the camera shuts down to conserve power, only starting up to record or after pressing the power switch.
